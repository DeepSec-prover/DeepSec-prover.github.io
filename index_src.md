Automated verification has become an essential part in the security
evaluation of cryptographic protocols. Recently, there has been a
considerable effort to lift the theory and tool support that existed
for reachability properties to the more complex case of equivalence
properties.

**DeepSec** is a verification tool which allows verification of trace
equivalence and equivalence by session for a large variety of user
defined cryptographic primitives---those that can be represented by a
subterm convergent destructor rewrite system.
